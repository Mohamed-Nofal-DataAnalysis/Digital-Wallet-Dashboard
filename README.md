## Questions (KPIs)

- What is the total number of transactions made via the digital wallet?
- What is the total payment amount and total cashback distributed?
- Which transaction status is most common (Success, Failed, Pending)?
- Which devices (Android, iOS, Web) are most commonly used for transactions?
- Who are the top 5 customers based on payment value?
- Which merchants have the highest transaction volumes or values?
- What is the distribution of transactions by country?

## Process
- Data Cleaning
- Removed duplicates
- Fixed date formats
- Handled missing values
- Standardized column names (e.g., Payment Type, Status, Device Type)
- Converted numeric columns to appropriate data types
- Data Exploration
- Reviewed key fields like transaction amount, cashback, status, customer & merchant names
- Identified distributions and outliers
- Checked unique values in categorical fields (e.g., device types, countries)
- Data Transformation
- Created pivot tables for aggregation
- Calculated total payments, cashback, and transaction count
- Grouped data by user, merchant, device, and country
- KPI Development
- Defined key metrics: total payments, cashback, top users, top merchants, success rate
- Built supporting metrics like payment method distribution and device usage
- Dashboard Visualization
- Used Excel charts (bar, pie, column) for visual storytelling
- Designed dashboard layout for clarity and easy navigation
- Highlighted key trends using conditional formatting and colors
